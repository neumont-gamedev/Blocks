This project is a skeleton of a very basic block breaker game (**Breakout**). <br/>
The intention is to have the student focus on the presentation of the game. These are the presentation elements that are expected:

* Audio (SFX/Music)
* Title/Game Over Screen
* Interpolation of object transforms
* Effects
  * Particles
  * Trails
  * Screenshake
  * Material Effects
    * Color Swap
    * UV Scroll
